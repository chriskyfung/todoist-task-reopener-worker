This project is a serverless Cloudflare Worker that automatically reopens completed Todoist tasks that have the label `tracked` or `routine`. It is designed as a robust, reliable, and secure replacement for a similar n8n workflow.

The worker runs on a schedule, checking for recently completed tasks and reopening them to ensure recurring items are not missed.

## Background

This project is inspired by an [n8n-based Todoist automation](https://medium.com/@chriskyfung/never-forget-a-recurring-task-again-an-n8n-todoist-automation-guide-4a810fef06c2) (Medium article).

## Features

- **Automated Task Reopening:** Automatically reopens completed Todoist tasks with a specific label.
- **Serverless:** Runs on the Cloudflare Workers serverless platform.
- **Scheduled Execution:** Uses a cron trigger to run on a schedule.
- **Secure:** Uses Cloudflare's secrets store to manage the Todoist API token.
- **Stateless:** Does not store any data.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the development workflow. The following workflows are in place:

- **CI:** On every push and pull request to the `main` branch, the CI workflow runs linting, testing, and building to ensure code quality and that the project is always in a working state.
- **CodeQL:** The CodeQL workflow runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch to analyze the code for security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependabot:** Dependabot is configured to automatically create pull requests to keep the project's dependencies up-to-date.
- **Release Drafter:** The Release Drafter workflow automatically creates draft release notes as pull requests are merged, making it easier to create new releases.

## Technologies

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/#overview)
- [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [Cloudflare Account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chriskyfung/todoist-reopener-worker.git
   cd todoist-reopener-worker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set API Tokens:**

   Provide your Todoist API token and a secret token for the manual trigger to Cloudflare's secret manager. You will be prompted to paste the tokens.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put TODOIST_API_TOKEN
   npx wrangler secret put CRON_SECRET_TOKEN
   ```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Build the project. |
| `npm run clean` | Remove the `dist` and `node_modules` directories. |
| `npm run deploy` | Deploy the worker. |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server. |
| `npm run lint` | Lint the code. |
| `npm run start` | Start the development server. |
| `npm run test` | Run tests. |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode. |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run tests with coverage. |
| `npm run tail` | View the logs of the worker in real-time. |

## Deployment

To deploy this worker, you will need a Cloudflare account and the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).

1. **Deploy:**
   Deploy the worker and its cron trigger to your Cloudflare account.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing. The tests are run in a realistic Cloudflare Workers environment using `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. The tests are located in the `src` directory and have a `.test.ts` extension.

- To run the tests, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- To run the tests in watch mode, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- To generate a coverage report, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run test:coverage
  ```

## Manual Trigger

To manually trigger the worker, you can send a `GET` request to the `/__run-cron` endpoint. You will need to include the `Authorization` header with your `CRON_SECRET_TOKEN`.

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/--run-cron \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET_TOKEN"
```
